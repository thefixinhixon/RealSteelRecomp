"""Freeze the build-graph codegen rule in generated/rexglue.cmake.

Codegen regenerates rexglue.cmake on every run, restoring the live
rule - which then re-fires during builds and OVERWRITES the hand
fixes (fix-tailcalls). This replaces the rule with a
stamp-only no-op: codegen for this project is a manual CLI step.
Idempotent: exits quietly if the freeze is already in place.
