"""fix-tailcalls.py - Real Steel post-codegen fix.

Codegen leaves REX_FATAL stubs for a handful of cross-references its
FunctionNode analysis could not link, even though every target IS a
fully generated function:

  * Tail calls:  `b 0xTARGET` at the end of a function emits
        REX_FATAL("Unresolved call from 0xSRC to 0xTARGET");
    The target has a DEFINE_REX_FUNC body, so the stub becomes a plain
    call (the `return;` codegen already emitted after the stub keeps
    the tail-call semantics).

  * Branches into an address that is both a function entry and a local
    label inside the SAME generated body emit
        if (cond) REX_FATAL("Unresolved branch from 0xSRC to 0xTARGET");
    (or the unguarded fallthrough shape). The label exists in the same
    file, so the stub becomes `goto loc_TARGET;`.

The script asserts every replacement is justified (target defined /
label present in-file) and fails loudly otherwise.
